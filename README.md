# OpenHoW

### What's this? :astonished:
OpenHoW aims to be an open-source implementation of Hogs of War,
a game produced by Gremlin Interactive.

The entire project is being built from the ground, supporting 
content from both the PC and PSX releases of the game, and 
the end goal will be to produce a completely open and free 
version of the game, featuring completely new assets to 
replace those of the original (think 
[FreeDOOM](https://freedoom.github.io/)).

Right now the project is only in it's infancy and a lot of focus
is currently going towards producing an engine for the game to be 
built upon; right now the primary part of this is creatively called 
the [platform library](https://github.com/TalonBraveInfo/platform).

Another task that is currently being looked into are tools that will
allow for easy modification of OpenHoW -
though compatibility with the original isn't a huge concern right 
now.

### Features :page_with_curl:
Consider this more of a wish-list at this  point in time ;)
* Support for Windows, macOS and Linux, with possibly more to follow!
* An editor to allow for easy modification of game-data
* Enhanced graphics over the original game
